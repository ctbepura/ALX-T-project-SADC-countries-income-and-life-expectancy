# ALX-T-project-SADC-countries-income-and-life-expectancy
Tracking the progression on income and life expectancy for the 16 SADC countries over the last 5 decades

This project, which is in partial fulfillment of ALX-T Data Analyst nanodegree program through Udacity, tracks the progress made by the 16 Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries across various metrics for the 5 decades between 1971 and 2020.

# Data
For this project I will use data from Gapminder (https://www.gapminder.org/data/). For my analysis, I have specifically selected the following indicators:

Income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted): Gross domestic product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power (in international dollars, fixed 2011 prices, PPPbased on 2011 ICP).
Life expectancy (years): The average number of years a newborn would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same.
Life expectancy, male: Life expectancy at birth for males
Life expectancy, female: Life expectancy at birth for females

# Motivation for this project
This is a project that is close to my heart, as someone who is born and bred in Southern Africa. I have lived through our challenges as well as celebrated our successes over the course of my life. It is fascinating to be able to put some numbers to the joys and tribulations that we have lived through, as well as paint a few pictures that are ‘worth more than a thousand words’ through the visualizations that I produced for this project.
